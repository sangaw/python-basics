# For creating a project

Hi - I want to build a python project to test candlestick patterns. 
FIrst step is to write a python code to get NIFTY day price - open, low, high and close and then work out which candle it is. 
For this, we will have src package for the code, test package for the code, gitingore and README.md file
Then please add log statements in the code and log folder to store the logs
Then please add config folder to store configs. For local run, please store the key credentials in local-settings.json.
Do not commit sensitive and credential information to github
